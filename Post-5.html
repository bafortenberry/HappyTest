										<p>Quality social relationships are the most important factor in promoting longevity, well-being, and happiness.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8KkKuTCFvzI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

										</body>
										
										<p>The researchers broke down the chart above - Circumstance refers to broader, external conditions surrounding life. Think income, living conditions, access to goods, etc. Set Point refers to genetic predisposition or the approximate level we are wired to fall into holding all else equal. Finally, the Intentional Activity piece refers to conscious efforts we can make to increase our well-being.</p>
										<p>Robert Waldinger is a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and director of the Grant Study, the 75-year study on adult happiness.</p>
										<p>Since 1938 Harvard researchers have followed 724 men tracking their work, home life, health, etc (the longest psychological study in history). The first group consisted of Harvard sophomores. The second group was from Boston’s poorest, most troubled neighborhoods. Since entering the study, they've all been subjected to the same interviews, examinations, and procedures every to years to this day.</p>
										<p>What has the study found?</p>
										<p>It seems that wealth and fame are irrelevant. So too are income and work. Social connection matters most for happiness. But it’s not just about quantity either, quality of relationships is key.</p>
										<p>In addition to happiness effects, good relationships protect the brain and body. Analyzing the data from when the subjects were 50 years old, the most significant predictor of longevity was satisfaction with relationships. Secure relationships promote healthier memory and cognitive function, while memory decline occurs earlier in those with poor relationships.</p>
										<p>Waldinger puts it, “Good relationships keep us happier and healthier, period.” People with quality connections are not only happier, but they are healthier and live longer.</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">The Surprising Science of Happiness by Dan Gilbert</h4>
										<p>You can think of natural happiness as a response to positive external circumstances and synthetic happiness as our mind’s tendency to create happiness from accepting what is. Our society tends to favor the "natural", but the "synthetic" is just as good.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKE-BMXz_RE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Dan Gilbert is a Harvard social psychologist and author of Stumbling on Happiness.</p>
										<p>As brains evolve they gain new structures. Humans have grown something called a prefrontal cortex - it is an experience simulator. Just like pilots use simulators, humans do too. All of us have done this and no other animal can do it quite like us. Let's put this skill to use...</p>
										<p>You have two options, do you want to win the lottery or become paraplegic? That's obvious right?</p>
										<p>Actually, data collected after one year shows that these groups are equally happy.</p>
										<p>We exhibit something called "impact bias" – basically our simulators overestimate how much things will affect us. We overlook the fact that happiness can be synthesized. We have a "psychological immune system" which helps us change our views of the world so that we can feel better about the worlds in which we find ourselves. We can actually synthesize happiness inside but think it has to be found outside. Here are a few examples...</p>
										<p>The founder of McDonald's was tricked out of his business and says it was the best thing that has ever happened to him. The Beatles original drummer was cut from the band and said he's glad he was. Finally, how often have you heard someone say that "his or her leaving was the best thing for me" after a breakup.</p>
										<p>These peoples have something to show us. Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we want and synthetic is what we make when we don’t get it. And our society thinks only natural counts for something. This is a product of economic capitalism and consumerism. Synthetic is just as real and enduring and the kind you get when you stumble upon something you wanted.</p>
										<p>“We can manufacture the very commodity (happiness) that we are constantly chasing.”</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">The Habits of Happiness by Matthieu Ricard</h4>
										<p>We often mistake happiness for pleasure; this is a critical error. Pleasure is temporary, using itself up as it goes. Happiness is a sustainable, joyful well-being attained through mind training.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbLEf4HR74E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Matheiu Ricard is a former molecular biologist who abandoned academia to live as a Buddhist monk. He is the author of multiple books including Happiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill.</p>
										<p>There seems to be a common misconception where pleasure is mistaken for happiness. This is a big mistake. Pleasure is the flip-side of suffering - the two go hand in hand. This is because pleasure consumes itself as it goes. Its very existence burns itself out. Think of a chocolate cake: the first piece is delicious, the second piece is okay, and the third is disgusting. We may be very cold and go next to a hot fire and feel amazing but after a few seconds it's way too hot.</p>
										<p>We also tend to look outside. If we could just have everything to be happy that would be great, but that attitude is the doom of happiness. Our control of the outside world is very limited. On the other hand, we have internal conditions which translate outside conditions into either enjoyment or suffering. Of course, external conditions matter; however those alone are not enough. The mind is the device which translates external conditions to internal experience.</p>
										<p>There states of mind conducive to flourishing and joy and those which are destructive to it. Two opposite mental states – anger and joy – for instance, cannot occupy the mind at the same time. A trained mind observe anger, hate, fear, etc. as they arise and allow them to it to dissipate without disturbance. This is what Buddhists call mind training, but modern neuroscience has observed it too. Researchers studied neuroplasticity amongst the monks from Ricard’s group. They found that skilled meditators were basically off-the-charts on measurements of compassion and joy.</p>
										<p>The point here is that the mind can be trained to favor states which promote well-being and happiness.</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">The Riddle of Experience vs. Memory by Daniel Kahneman</h4>
										<p>The study of happiness has been methodologically flawed by failing to account for the differences in experienced happiness – associated mainly with pleasant emotions -- versus remembered (reflective) happiness – associated mainly with accomplishment.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgRlrBl-7Yg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Daniel Kahneman is a renowned psychologist and behavioral economist. He is the author of Thinking; Fast & Slow.</p>
										<p>There have been over 40 books published in the last few years with "happiness" in the title. However, there are a few cognitive traps that make it nearly impossible to analyze happiness. The biggest trap is the confusion between being happy in your life and being happy with your life. This is the riddle of experience versus memory.</p>
										<p>Imagine we had gone to a beautiful symphony. It was an amazing performance, but at the very end a performer missed a note and made a terrible screeching sound. It totally ruined the performance. But hadn’t we already had the experience? We had enjoyed twenty minutes of happy experience but our memory colors the event as unhappy.</p>
										<p>We can think of two selves – the experiencing self and the remembering self. The remembering self is a storyteller who follows the peak-end rule. The remembering-self measures memories in terms of the peak emotional state associated with it and how it ended. This is illustrated in a study with two sets of patients who underwent painful procedures. In one set the procedure lasted a few minutes longer, but with peak pain at the beginning. In the other the procedure was shorter but with peak pain at the end. Those in group one, who actually suffered longer, reported less suffering. So, we have or riddle.</p>
										<p>The remembering self’s happiness can directly contradict the experiencing self’s happiness.</p>
										<p>This dual-self problem comes to a head with income. For the experiencing self, the correlation between money and happiness drops off around $70,000. For the reflective self the two are fairly correlated.</p>
										<p>There is really a different happiness for each of our "selves". We can know a lot about how satisfied we are with life and still have no idea how happily we live life. In fact, the correlation between the two is only about 0.5. We should be doing very different things depending on which happiness we want to elevate.</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">Flow, the Secret to Happiness by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi</h4>
										<p>Striking an adequate balance between challenge and skills leads to a state of optimal experience characterized by stepping out of the ordinary reality into a state of engaged, selflessness. Consistent experience of this state is conducive to long-term happiness.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXIeFJCqsPs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi is a noted psychologist and author of Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience.</p>
										<p>We begin by acknowledging the statistical fact that on the societal level - happiness does not rise with wealth once we rise above the poverty line. Over the last century economic growth has not really enhanced human morale. So what does facilitate happiness? Perhaps creative individuals like artists and scientists have something to offer. For example, as Csikszentmihalyi began his research, one composer expressed an "ecstasy" which comes about in the middle of performance. This state is we now know as flow.</p>
										<p>Flow is an alternate reality which we can step into outside of our normal routines. Every culture has locations or methodologies for entering this space. The composer also said that during these moments of creative expression he felt like he didn't exist and his hands were moving by themselves. This pattern emerges wherever creativity is found: science, art, business, and more.</p>
										<p>The flow pattern is comprised of eight elements. We must be completely involved in what we're doing (1). There should be a sense of being outside of everyday reality (2). We must have inner clarity (3) and the capacity to complete the task (4). There should be a sense of serenity (5), a sense of timelessness (6), and an intrinsic motivation (7). Finally, thought and action should merge (8).</p>
										<p>Optimal experience occurs when we strike a balance between challenge and skill, anxiety and control, thought and action.</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">The New Era of Positive Psychology by Martin Seligman</h4>
										<p>The happy life can be thought of in three ways: the pleasant life (maximum positive emotion), the engaged life (maximum time spent in flow), and the meaningful life (use of character strengths to serve something larger than yourself). These "lives' exhibit an emergent, synergistic effect as when they are all present happiness is amplified to a level greater than the sum of the parts.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9FBxfd7DL3E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Martin Seligman is the former president of the American Psychological Association and is regarded as the founder of positive psychology. He is the author of Authentic Happiness, Learned Optimism, and Flourish</p>
										<p>For the longest time psychology worked on the disease model viz. "what's wrong with you?". The downside of this approach was that psychologists became pathologists and victimizers, often forgetting that humans are responsible agents. Psychology also forgot about normal people and improving normal lives. Finally, under the disease psychologists sought to repair damage and never thought about preemptive positive interventions to make people happier.</p>
										<p>All this changed with positive psychology.</p>
										<p>Positive psychologists contend that we should be just as concerned with strength as with weakness, with building as repairing, and with nurturing high talent in the lives of normal people as helping diseased people. Researchers have begun to ask how very happy people differ from the rest of us?</p>
										<p>We can think about this question in terms of three happy lives: the pleasant life (where positive emotions are maximized), the engaged life (lots of flow), and the meaningful life (where we serve a greater cause).</p>
										<p>The pleasant life consists of as many of the positives as you can and learning the skills to amplify the positives. There are two drawbacks to this area: 50% of this is hereditary positive emotions habituate quickly (they wear out). The engaged life is different from pleasure as pleasure has raw feels but in flow we don’t feel anything. We just merge with the moment’s action. The third path is meaning, which is traditionally the most venerable. We must know our greatest strengths and use them to serve something larger.</p>
										<p>Within each of these "lives" we find that interventions and exercises work. We can design a beautiful day and enhance it using mindfulness practice. We can do a gratitude visit to someone important to us and read them an essay about what they have done for us. Each of these interventions will increase participant happiness.</p>
										<p>In equation form you get - Life Satisfaction = pleasant life + engaged life + meaningful life but all these together exhibit an emergent, systemic property in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</p>

										<h4 class="mt-0">How to Buy Happiness by Michael Norton</h4>
										<p>Money can buy happiness. Spending money on others improves your happiness and the dynamic within teams.</p>
										<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PsihkFWDt3Y" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
										<p>Michael Norton is a professor at Harvard Business School and author of multiple books which explore the optimal use of money for happiness.</p>
										<p>It turns out that when people win the lottery it typically ruins their lives. They end up with more debt and worse friendships. When asked to read an article which summarized the above results, readers gave an odd response: they fantasized about what they would have done with the money instead of acknowledging the truth of the article.</p>
										<p>We have a hard time supplanting our intuition with data-driven facts. But the truth is money often makes us selfish and antisocial. The old adage states that money cannot buy happiness. Maybe we are just spending money the wrong way?</p>
										<p>Researchers designed an experiment which consisted of giving a student an envelope of money – some were told to spend the money on themselves and others to spend the money on others. At the beginning and end researchers asked each student how happy he or she felt. What happened? People who spent money on others were happier, while those who spend it on themselves showed no change. It also didn’t seem to matter what the quantity of money was, just the spending it on others mattered.</p>
										<p>Did this hold true everywhere else? In Uganda researchers did the same study. Again, we see human universals. The way doesn’t matter but the fact that you spend on someone else is what matters. Analyzing data worldwide from Gallup, researchers found that those who donated money to charity were correlated to increased happiness. Research also found that within a business unit those who spent money on each other earned a much higher return on investment. Teams who spend money on themselves perform better.</p>
										<p>Money can buy us happiness, if we know how to spend it.</p>
